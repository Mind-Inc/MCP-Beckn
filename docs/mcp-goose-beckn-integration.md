# Integrating MCP, Goose, and Beckn: Technical Overview

This document explains how Model Context Protocol (MCP), Block's Goose orchestration framework, and Beckn Protocol work together to enable AI assistants to interact with real-world services in a decentralized, open ecosystem.

## Understanding the Three Technologies

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP is a standard developed by Anthropic that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to connect to external tools, APIs, or context servers. Key features include:

- Model-agnostic design for compatibility across different AI systems
- Support for tools, function calling, and context retrieval
- Structured request/response format for reliable integration
- Conversation context preservation across interactions

MCP allows AI assistants to perform real-world tasks by interacting with external systems, making it an ideal bridge to Beckn's real-world services.

### Block's Goose Framework

Goose is an open-source agent orchestration framework developed by Block (formerly Square). Key features include:

- Tool registration and management for agent capabilities
- Workflow definition and execution for complex tasks
- Dynamic script evaluation for flexible processing
- State management across multi-step operations

Goose provides the orchestration layer needed to manage the complex, multi-step transactions common in Beckn Protocol.

### Beckn Protocol

Beckn is an open protocol that enables location-aware, dynamic discovery of services across different domains. Key features include:

- Domain-agnostic design for applicability across various sectors
- Decentralized architecture preventing platform monopolies
- Standardized communication flows for digital commerce
- Multi-step transaction lifecycle (search, select, init, confirm)

Beckn enables direct connections between consumers and providers without intermediary platforms, making it ideal for creating open AI-commerce ecosystems.

## The Integration Architecture

The integration follows a layered approach:

1. **AI Assistants** connect to the system using Model Context Protocol
2. **MCP Server** receives and processes MCP requests
3. **Intent Mapper** translates natural language to structured intents
4. **Goose Orchestrator** manages the transaction workflow
5. **Beckn Client** communicates with Beckn Protocol networks
6. **Beckn Networks** connect to real-world service providers

### Data Flow Example

Let's trace a simple example: "Book me a ride from MG Road to the airport"

#### 1. AI to MCP Server
The AI assistant sends an MCP request:
```json
{
  "query": "Book me a ride from MG Road to the airport",
  "context": {
    "user_id": "user123",
    "conversation_id": "conv456"
  }
}
```

#### 2. MCP Server to Intent Mapper
The MCP server passes the query to the Intent Mapper, which identifies:
- Domain: mobility
- Operation: search (initial step of booking)
- Parameters:
  - origin: "mg road"
  - destination: "airport"

#### 3. Intent Mapper to Goose Orchestrator
The mapped intent is passed to the Goose Orchestrator:
```json
{
  "domain": "mobility",
  "operation": "search",
  "parameters": {
    "origin": "mg road",
    "destination": "airport"
  },
  "context": {
    "user_id": "user123",
    "conversation_id": "conv456"
  }
}
```

#### 4. Goose Orchestrator to Beckn Client
Goose determines the workflow based on the operation (search) and calls the appropriate Beckn Client method with the parameters.

#### 5. Beckn Client to Beckn Network
The Beckn Client creates and sends a Beckn Protocol search request:
```json
{
  "context": {
    "domain": "mobility",
    "action": "search",
    "transaction_id": "txn_12345"
  },
  "message": {
    "intent": {
      "fulfillment": {
        "start": {
          "location": {
            "gps": "12.9758,77.6096"
          }
        },
        "end": {
          "location": {
            "gps": "12.9499,77.6681"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### 6. Beckn Network to Providers
The Beckn network forwards the request to mobility providers (like Namma Yatri, Uber, Ola) who return ride options.

#### 7. Results Back to AI
The results flow back through the layers, with each adding appropriate context:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "options": [
      {
        "provider": "Namma Yatri",
        "services": [
          {
            "id": "ny-auto-1",
            "name": "Auto Rickshaw",
            "price": 150,
            "currency": "INR",
            "estimatedTime": "15 min"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "provider": "Uber",
        "services": [
          {
            "id": "uber-go-1",
            "name": "Uber Go",
            "price": 250,
            "currency": "INR",
            "estimatedTime": "12 min"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "conversation_context": {
    "transaction_id": "txn_12345",
    "domain": "mobility",
    "state": "search_completed"
  }
}
```

The AI can now present these options to the user and proceed with the next steps (select, init, confirm) through additional MCP requests.

## Technical Integration Details

### MCP - Goose Integration

The MCP server integrates with Goose through the Orchestrator component:

```typescript
// MCP request processing
app.post('/mcp/v1', async (req, res) => {
  const { query, context } = req.body;
  
  // Map query to intent
  const intent = await intentMapper.mapQueryToIntent(query, context);
  
  // Use Goose to orchestrate workflow
  const result = await orchestrator.execute(intent);
  
  // Return result in MCP format
  return res.status(200).json({
    status: 'success',
    data: result,
    conversation_context: {
      transaction_id: result.transaction_id,
      domain: intent.domain,
      state: result.state
    }
  });
});
```

Goose tools are registered for each Beckn operation:

```typescript
// Register tools for Beckn operations
this.goose.registerTool({
  name: 'beckn_search',
  description: 'Search for services in the Beckn network',
  parameters: {
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
      domain: { type: 'string' },
      parameters: { type: 'object' }
    },
    required: ['domain', 'parameters']
  },
  execute: async (args) => {
    return await this.becknClient.search(args.domain, args.parameters);
  }
});
```

### Goose - Beckn Integration

Goose workflows translate to Beckn Protocol operations through the BecknClient:

```typescript
// Goose workflow example (simplified)
async function workflow(context) {
  // Extract intent from context
  const { domain, parameters } = context.intent;
  
  // Step 1: Search
  const searchResults = await tools.beckn_search({
    domain,
    parameters
  });
  
  // State after search
  return {
    status: 'completed',
    results: searchResults,
    transaction_id: searchResults.transactionId,
    state: 'search_completed'
  };
}
```

The BecknClient handles the creation of protocol-specific requests:

```typescript
// BecknClient search method
async search(domain: string, parameters: any): Promise<any> {
  // Create Beckn Protocol search request
  const searchRequest = this.createSearchRequest(domain, parameters);
  
  // Send to Beckn gateway
  const response = await fetch(`${this.gatewayUrls[domain]}/search`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(searchRequest)
  });
  
  // Process and return results
  const searchResults = await response.json();
  return this.processSearchResults(searchResults);
}
```

### Multi-Step Transaction Lifecycle

A complete Beckn transaction typically follows this lifecycle:

1. **Search**: Discover available services matching intent
2. **Select**: Choose a specific service option
3. **Init**: Initiate the transaction with selected options
4. **Confirm**: Finalize and complete the transaction
5. **Status** (optional): Check transaction status
6. **Update** (optional): Modify existing transaction
7. **Cancel** (optional): Cancel a confirmed transaction

The Goose orchestrator manages this workflow, maintaining state between steps and allowing for complex decision-making. For example, after receiving search results, the AI might ask the user which option to select before proceeding to the next step.

## How Conversation Context Works

The integration maintains conversation context across multiple interactions:

1. **Initial Context Creation**: When a transaction begins, a transaction ID and state are generated.
2. **Context Preservation**: This context is returned to the AI with each response.
3. **Context Usage**: The AI includes this context in subsequent requests.
4. **State Tracking**: The system tracks the transaction state (e.g., "search_completed", "selection_completed").

Example of conversation flow:

1. User: "Book me a ride from MG Road to the airport"
2. AI: "I found several options. Would you like an auto for ₹150 (15 min) or an Uber Go for ₹250 (12 min)?"
   - Context stored: `{ "transaction_id": "txn_12345", "domain": "mobility", "state": "search_completed" }`
3. User: "I'll take the Uber"
4. AI sends another MCP request with:
   - Query: "I'll take the Uber"
   - Context: `{ "transaction_id": "txn_12345", "domain": "mobility", "state": "search_completed" }`
5. System:
   - Recognizes ongoing transaction from context
   - Maps intent to "select" operation for the Uber option
   - Proceeds with selection in the Beckn network
6. AI: "I've selected the Uber. Would you like to confirm the booking?"
   - Updated context: `{ "transaction_id": "txn_12345", "domain": "mobility", "state": "selection_completed" }`

This stateful conversation allows for complex, multi-step transactions while maintaining a natural conversational experience.

## Advantages of This Integration

### Decentralized AI Commerce

By integrating MCP with Beckn Protocol, this system enables AI assistants to interact with real-world services without creating new intermediaries or gatekeepers. The AI simply facilitates a direct connection between users and service providers.

### Open Ecosystem

The integration preserves the open nature of Beckn Protocol while extending its reach to AI systems. Any AI that supports MCP can connect to any service on any Beckn network, promoting competition and innovation.

### Flexibility Across Domains

This architecture works across multiple domains (mobility, retail, food, healthcare, etc.) without requiring domain-specific AI training. The Intent Mapper and BecknClient components handle domain-specific translations.

### Modular Design

The layered, modular architecture allows for:
- Replacing components independently (e.g., upgrading the Intent Mapper without changing other components)
- Supporting multiple AI systems through the standardized MCP interface
- Adding new Beckn domains without restructuring the system
- Evolving the implementation as technologies mature

## Production Considerations

### NLU/Intent Mapping

For production use, the intent mapping should be enhanced with more sophisticated natural language understanding:
- Using LLMs for intent extraction and parameter identification
- Adding context-aware interpretation of user requests
- Supporting complex, multi-intent queries
- Handling domain-specific terminology and entities

### Error Handling and Recovery

Production implementations should include robust error handling:
- Recovery from failed Beckn network requests
- Handling timeout and availability issues
- Managing inconsistent states between components
- Providing meaningful error messages for AI assistants

### Security and Authentication

When deploying in production:
- Secure the MCP endpoint with authentication
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Use proper credential management for Beckn network access
- Ensure compliance with data protection regulations

### Monitoring and Observability

Implement comprehensive monitoring:
- Transaction success/failure rates
- Performance metrics for each component
- Error logging and alerting
- User experience tracking

## Conclusion

The integration of MCP, Goose, and Beckn creates a powerful bridge between AI assistants and real-world services while preserving the open, decentralized nature of the Beckn ecosystem. This approach prevents the creation of new gatekeepers while democratizing access to services through conversational AI interfaces.

By leveraging the strengths of each technology:
- MCP provides a standardized way for AIs to access external tools
- Goose manages the complex workflows required for multi-step transactions
- Beckn Protocol enables direct connections to a wide range of service providers

This integration represents a significant step toward an open AI commerce ecosystem that benefits users, providers, and AI systems alike.
