# MCP-Beckn Integration Enhancement

This PR implements major enhancements to the MCP-Beckn integration based on the Enhancement Plan, focusing on making the system more modular, testable, and developer-friendly.

## Major Changes

1. **Orchestration Abstraction**:
   - Created pluggable orchestration layer with unified interface
   - Added support for different orchestration engines (Goose, MindNet, LangGraph)
   - Implemented factory pattern for orchestrator creation
   - Added runtime registration system for third-party orchestrators
   - Added generator script for custom orchestrators

2. **MCP Shell Server**:
   - Created standalone MCP server for testing
   - Added realistic mock responses for all domains
   - Implemented transaction state tracking
   - Added support for the complete SRPC lifecycle

3. **State Management**:
   - Added persistent transaction state tracking
   - Implemented state transitions and history
   - Created cleanup mechanisms for old transactions
   - Added transaction querying capabilities

4. **Request/Response Validation**:
   - Added schema validation for MCP payloads
   - Implemented validation middleware for Express
   - Created programmatic validation utilities
   - Defined clear error messages and handling

5. **Enhanced Beckn Simulation**:
   - Created realistic domain-specific Beckn responses
   - Added support for the full transaction lifecycle
   - Implemented simulated network latency
   - Added transaction tracking capabilities

6. **Diagnostic Tools**:
   - Added comprehensive logging middleware
   - Created testing dashboard web interface
   - Implemented request tracing with unique IDs
   - Added transaction visualization tools

## Other Changes

- Updated documentation with new features and components
- Added examples for custom orchestrators
- Created testing utilities for orchestrators
- Updated package.json with new dependencies and scripts
- Added API documentation for new modules

## Testing

All new components have been tested manually. To test these changes:

1. **MCP Shell Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run shell
   ```

2. **Testing Dashboard**:
   ```bash
   npm run dashboard
   ```

3. **Custom Orchestrator Generator**:
   ```bash
   npm run generate MyOrchestrator
   ```

## Documentation

New documentation has been added:

- `docs/custom-orchestrators.md`: Guide for creating custom orchestrators
- `docs/testing/shell-server.md`: Using the MCP Shell Server
- `docs/testing/dashboard.md`: Using the testing dashboard
- `docs/api/validation.md`: Request/response validation
- `docs/api/state-management.md`: Transaction state management
- `docs/api/beckn-simulator.md`: Using the Beckn simulator

## Future Work

This PR addresses the high-priority items from the Enhancement Plan. Future work will include:

- Additional integration tests 
- Enhanced security features
- Further orchestration engine implementations
- Production deployment optimizations

## Breaking Changes

None. This PR maintains backward compatibility with existing integrations while adding new capabilities.
